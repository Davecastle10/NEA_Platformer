1. Do traditional revision methods e.g. mindmaps or flash cards, provide you with good exam results?

2. How long do you remain engaged and focused when utilising traditional revision methods?

3. Would you personally benefit from a more fun revision method such as a video game, and if so how much do you think it would benefit you?

4. Do you believe the solution that I have proposed to help students with their revision will be a goof solution for the problem of 'students struggling to revise boring or not engaign topics'?
