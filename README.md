## This is where my computer science NEA (Non Examined Assessment) work will be.

At the moment most of the code is taken from a tutorial by dafluffypotatos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gABYM5M0ww&t=6923s, as I am following it until I get to the point where he implements his level editor, and at that point I will go and work backwards changing the code to be fully my own whilst ensuring the level editor still functions.
