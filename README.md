# NEA_Platformer
## This is where my computer science NEA (Non Examined Assessment) work will be.

At the moment most of the code is taken from a tutorial by dafluffypotatos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gABYM5M0ww&t=6923s, as I am following it until I get to the point where he implements his level editor, and at that point I will go and work backwards changing the code to be fully my own whilst ensuring the level editor still functions.

now i have implemnetd the level editor properly, i need to go back and optimise the game for pygame-ce, and by doing this i should end up replacing a significant amount fo the code, so i would actually be able to submit the game as my own.

Once that is done i can go in and add a gui menu for the game (probably with tkinter), and then i can add in the question system, enemies and combat, i think the plan will also be to make a gui for the level editor, so that the players can make their own levels and add in their own questions. And if i get all of that done, i will try to add in procedural level generation.
