# NEA_Platformer
## This is where my computer science NEA (Non Examined Assessment) work will be.

This is the Github repo for my 2024 OCR A-level computer science NEA. I have marked what code is my own and what code is from external sources via the comments in the individual files - the tutorila I mention a lot by dafluffypotatos on youtube can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gABYM5M0ww&t=6923s. Some of the files like the 'entities' and 'enetities_copy_with_teleporty_physics' files are legacy files that are not needed for the game to run, and are not used in the final code, but I have kept them in the repository because they served as a valuable point of refernce for whilst I was coding the game, and could continue to do so if I happen to revisit this project in a few years time.
